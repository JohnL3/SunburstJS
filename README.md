This is an attempt at a new template for newbies (especially coming from FreeCodeCamp, and looking for an update to [ClementineJS](http://www.clementinejs.com/tutorials/tutorial-beginner.html)) to fullstack javascript development.

It uses React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend, and Apollo/GraphQL to connect the two.

Useful resources when building this:
